<b>A major earthquake on July 7th impacted thousands of poor families in Chiapas and Guatemala.</b> The quake destroyed homes or made them too unsafe to live in. Many of these families had already suffered the loss of income due to the failure of the coffee crop on which they depend for a living.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of our community, Dr. Tamara Brennan was able to go to remote villages in the mountains to provide auricular acupuncture to reduce the traumatic stress people were experiencing.  As one woman put it, "This has made all the difference for me.  I feel like myself again." We received donations of over 10,000 acupuncture needles from acupuncture practitioners in Arizona, Lhasa OMS and Golden Flower Herbs.

We are preparing a team to go to Oaxaca, Mexico to assist the population traumatized by the massive losses from the 8.2 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks, a crisis that began September 7th, 2017. We've learned that aid is not reaching the poorest, indigenous communities where damage was extreme. Tbere has been a call from aid workers for help for people who are suffering deep trauma and are further terrified with each strong aftershock. We have an experienced 3 person team to be headed by Sexto Sol Executive Director adn psychologist Dr. Tamara Brennan. Please help us get there with your tax-deductible contribution to our <a href="/donations.html">Solidarity with Oaxaca Fund</a> to provide this help for Indigenous communities in the isthmus of Oaxaca.</a>  </p>

<p>"Imagine the human potential and creative power that could be released as collective trauma is healed. Humanity needs that power to resolve 
the urgent problems we now face and to finally eliminate war and poverty from our world. With such elegant and effective tools available to us, 
now is the time to put them into the hands of the healers who will bring relief to their people." --Dr. Tamara Brennan, Executive Director</p> 

<p><b>Humanity has endured unspeakable suffering</b> as a result of war, forced relocation and exile, colonization, environmental 
devastation, globalization, chronic poverty, AIDs, and catastrophic natural disasters. For survivors of such life-changing tragedies, long-term 
emotional distress can lead to illness, affect family relationships, and make it difficult to do all that is necessary to rebuild their lives. 
Furthermore, trauma in a family can be absorbed by a person's children so powerfully that it becomes part of their identity.</p> 

<p><b>Fortunately, there are healing methods that have been shown to be remarkably effective</b> in alleviating traumatic stress and emotional 
suffering. Among these therapies are Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), auricular acupuncture, WHEE, Access Bars, and Inner RePatterning. 
These techniques are part of the leading-edge approach to healing known as energy medicine and energy psychology which engage the energetic system 
of the body to heal the body, mind and spirit. Researchers in the fields of epi-genetics, neuro-psychology, mindfulness and other disciplines are 
discovering exciting new information that shows how the brain can be "rewired" to create new emotional states. We are learning more about 
the complexity of the physical human heart and other body structures and how they also play a role in trauma and recovery. The Sexto Sol Center's 
work to help communities in crisis is informed by these new scientific discoveries that offer so much promise for healing.  You can view a video 
series by Dr. Craig Weiner on the science supporting EFT <a href="/science.html">here.</a>  Our thanks to him for making this available.</p>  

<p>Since 1997 it has been our privilege to have been able to make a difference in the lives of thousands of people in Chiapas, 
Mexico and Guatemala.  Yet we have always been concerned about the impact that serious challenges have on the emotional well-being of indigenous 
people and others who live close to the land. We created International Partners for Healing (IPH), or Alianza Internacional por la 
Superaci&oacute;n Emocional as an answer to what we see as a tremendous need for healing for communities of people who have collectively endured 
extreme events. IPH is an alliance of professional teachers of energy psychology and energy medicine and others who share Sexto Sol's commitment 
to alleviating the suffering of these populations that are suffering from traumatic events.

<h4>Photo: IPH was featured on EFT Hub Summit during an interview with June Spencer.</h4>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The mission of The Sexto Sol Center's IPH program is to make effective and easy to use therapies available for the most people possible 
in the places where a serious crisis has impacted the population. To accomplish this, IPH partners will formally train people who are well placed 
within their communities such as health care providers, traditional healers and others, so that they can then help their own people. The individuals whom we train will assist their 
community by offering these therapies in a culturally appropriate way while drawing on their own understanding of the significance of the traumatic 
events that took place. The training will be carried out under the coordination of the Sexto Sol Center. Projects will be carefully tailored to 
each humanitarian situation and political landscape, and will address the specific needs identified by the people themselves since they are also partners in 
the healing process. When possible we will include training in Nonviolent Communication. NVC is a method of effectively engaging with others to 
resolve conflict in a way that heals and leads to more enduring peace.</p>
 
<p>The unique contribution of Sexto Sol's International Partners for Healing program is to extend the reach of some of the most innovative and 
effective therapies into the corners of our world that cry for relief. We are honored to have among our partners innovators who have developed 
leading edge therapies that offer great promise for relieving the suffering of many people.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the IPH Effort</h3>

<p>Since 2006, we have been providing assistance to survivors of natural disasters to reduce the resulting psychological and emotional trauma that would otherwise cause them long term suffering and could lead to chronic illness. The International Partners for Healing program builds on the success of Sexto Sol's first collaboration with the Acupuncture International Brigade (AIB). In 2006 over half a million people in Chiapas, Mexico suffered the extreme devastation caused by Hurricane Stan. The majority of those affected lived in very poor, remote, mountain communities. In order to assist so many traumatized people, we sponsored the work of AIB's emergency response team of acupuncture instructors. Over 6 days the team trained 50 local doctors, nurses and indigenous healers at the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social hospital to use acupuncture to alleviate post traumatic stress (PTSD). They supervised the trainees as they treated hundreds of people who came day after day to find relief. The health care providers who took the training then went on to treat thousands of people in the affected cities and in the remote areas where people had lost everything. People walked long distances to get this help.</p>

<img src="/images/volunteers/Tamara_Brennan.JPG" width="100" class="floatLeft" />
The International Partners for Healing program was created by <b>Tamara Brennan, Ph.D.,</b> Executive Director of the Sexto Sol Center. She is a sociocultural and community psychologist with a commitment to assisting land-based communities to overcome the trauma resulting from war, exile, resource extraction or natural disaster. She promotes the use of the body-mind therapies that are proving to be highly effective in alleviating trauma. Tamara develops and coordinates the IPH responses to crisis situations in partnership with key people in the country affected, and, organizes all aspects of bringing the project into being. Her contribution to IPH training projects is to make relevant scientific information accessible in a way that bridges the Western understanding of the psycho-somatic aspects of trauma and healing with the Eastern orientation. In this way she hopes to contribute to the preparedness of people in country so that they can better help their own people. She believes that by alleviating suffering in populations in crisis, all humanity is uplifted. </p>
